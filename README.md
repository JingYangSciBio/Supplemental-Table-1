Supplemental Table 1. Five mice lacking intestinal SMAD4 expression ("KO") and five littermate control mice ("WT") had their colon microbiome composition compared. 16S targeted sequencing was performed on mouse stool pellets ("Pellet") and colon mucosal scrapings ("Scraping") and compared at the phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species levels. Values represent proportion of organisms detected per sample. Genotypes were split evenly between sexes. The five female mice were co-housed and the five male mice were co-housed, with bedding mixed between cages weekly.
